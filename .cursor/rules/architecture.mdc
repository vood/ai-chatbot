# Project Architecture

## Core Technologies

*   Framework: Next.JS 15
*   Runtime: Node.js 22
*   UI Library: React

## UI Components & Styling

*   Component Library: Shadcn UI
    *   Utilize standard Shadcn components whenever possible.
*   Icons: Lucide Icons
*   Notifications: Sonner for toasts

## Backend & Database (Supabase)

*   Database Interaction:
    *   All database logic must reside within `lib/db/queries`.
    *   Database queries must be executed server-side only. Direct client-side database access is prohibited.
    *   Use Next.js Server Actions to expose database functionality to the frontend when necessary.
*   Complex Server-Side Logic:
    *   For complex operations or endpoints, consider creating API routes under `/app/api/*`.

## Code Organization & Best Practices

*   Hooks: Encapsulate complex component logic within custom React Hooks.
*   Server-Side Logic: Keep database interactions and sensitive logic strictly on the server.
