# Project Architecture

## Core Technologies

*   Framework: Next.JS 15
*   Runtime: Node.js 22
*   UI Library: React, shadcn/ui
*   Backend Supabase   

## UI Components & Styling

*   Component Library: Shadcn UI
    *   Utilize standard Shadcn components whenever possible.
*   Icons: Lucide Icons
*   Notifications: Sonner for toasts, don't use custom hook

## Components and pages
* Shared components should be in the components directory
* Page related components should be in the /app/<page>/components/ directory

## Forms and crud
* Use zod for form validation
* Use react-hook-form for managing form state

## UI with shadcn/ui
* Use standard components of shadcn/ui as much as possible
* Use sonner for toasts / notifications
* All componets are in components/ui, if something is missing install with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`

## Backend & Database (Supabase)

*   Database Interaction:
    *   All database logic must reside within `lib/db/queries/<model>.ts`.
    *   Database queries must be executed server-side only. Direct client-side database access is prohibited.
    *   Use Next.js Server Actions to expose database functionality to the frontend when necessary.
*   Complex Server-Side Logic:
    *   For complex operations or endpoints, consider creating API routes under `/app/api/*`.

## Code Organization & Best Practices

*   Hooks: Encapsulate complex component logic within custom React Hooks.
*   Server-Side Logic: Keep database interactions and sensitive logic strictly on the server.

## AI Features & Integration

*   AI Provider Management: All AI provider configurations should be managed in `lib/ai/providers.ts`
*   AI Models: Model definitions and configurations should be maintained in `lib/ai/models.ts`
*   AI Tools: Custom AI tools and functions should be organized in `lib/ai/tools/` directory
*   Prompts: Reusable prompts and templates should be defined in `lib/ai/prompts.ts`

## Server Actions

*   Server Actions vs REST API: prefer rest api in /app/api/* directory over actions. 
*   Server Actions: Core server actions should be defined in the `/actions` directory
*   API Context: Keep server actions focused on specific database or external API operations
*   Authentication: All server actions must include proper authentication checks

## Project Features

*   Document Signing: All document signing related components and logic should be organized in the `/app/sign/` directory
*   Artifact Management: Components for handling artifacts should follow patterns in `components/artifact.tsx`
*   Chat Interface: Chat-related components should be consistent with existing patterns in `components/chat.tsx` and related files

## Testing & Code Quality

*   Testing: Tests should be organized in the `/tests` directory
*   Linting: Follow the Biome linting rules defined in `biome.jsonc`
*   Type Safety: Maintain strict TypeScript typing across the codebase

## Deployment & Environment

*   Environment Variables: All environment variables should be documented in `.env.example`
*   Supabase Integration: Follow the migration patterns defined in `supabase-migrations.mdc`
